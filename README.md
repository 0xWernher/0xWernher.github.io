# **Your Villa**

Your Villa acts as a key to the following:

1. Unique 3D Rendered Art
2. Neighborhoods and Districts
3. A Personal, Customizable Villa Page
4. Shared culture
5. The Community Rank Protocol

**THE ART**

Most all 3D NFT projects actually are combinations of 2D layers. This technique is useful for permutations, but didn’t allow us to produce the level of detail we wanted in our Villas. All Villas in Metavillage were designed and rendered fully in 3D with ray tracing engines, which trace every single ray of light and its reflections off of lakes, trees, pools, windows, and the like. This process required thousands of hours of render time across dozens of machines. We checked each NFT by hand to ensure all 3D objects had been correctly placed and rendered in the scene.

We decided that this path was well worth it to have real shadows and light reflections, something to set our collection apart from nearly every other 3D collection in the ecosystem. After months of 3D modeling, creating custom scripts for permutations in 3D space, and manually resolving dependency issues, every Villa is unique with its own light hues, reflections, and shadows.

**NEIGHBORHOOD AND DISTRICT ACCESS** 

Our custom-built verify system goes beyond Grape/Solaland and looks specifically at the metadata of your Villas. Owning a Villa gives you access to the specific Neighborhood and District channels that it is located in. This allows us to create smaller-unit communities within a broader Village.

**VILLA PAGE**

Every Villa comes with a unique link—the one link you need in web3. This is a crypto specific link in bio. Display your NFT collection with the Villa Gallery, have friends like your NFTs, drop viewers into your metaverse homes, add your social links, and more. The Villa Page is fully customizable with themes, decals, and added functions, all of which are unlocked via Upgrades.

**MEMBER SELECTION**

We built a custom whitelist token system based on Discord IDs and roles rather than wallet addresses. This ensured that bots and bad-faith minters couldn’t load up with many Villas (one per Discord) and allowed us to curate the right community composition at mint. 

**SHARED CULTURE**

With 14 Neighborhoods, 56 Districts, 840 Blocks, and 8400 Villas, the Village is tied together by a singular shared culture put forth by the art and lore. The lore is an ongoing narrative which deals with the ideologies surrounding the creation of the Village and grows alongside it as the Village progresses. Community members have also written pages upon pages of fan theories and in character role play based on their roles in the Village. The lore sets the tone and attracts the right people for our Village.

# **The Community Rank Protocol**

The Community Rank Protocol is designed around the idea that the rarity of your Villa(s) is tied to your contribution as a Villager.

The rarities of all Villas at mint are equal. You can increase their rarity level by earning coins, buying upgrades, and applying them to your Villa.

**COINS**

Coins are in-game currency that can be used to purchase Upgrades and level up the Rarity of your Villa. They can be viewed in your Villager’s Portal on the website: metavillage.app

Coin balances are held on a per-user basis, not a per Villa basis. They are held as long as you own at least one Villa. 

**EARNING COINS**

Coins can be earned in three ways:

**1. Passive: Increasing Daily Rewards**

These are “Loyalty Rewards,” similar to airlines. It’s important for the community to have the same Neighbors for long periods of time to be able to develop more meaningful relationships.

Each Villa produces a Coin reward everyday. The Daily Reward increases for each consecutive day you own the Villa: it’s a Daily Reward *Streak*. As an example (numbers not final):

Day 1: +10 coins. Total balance: 10

Day 2: +20 coins. Total balance: 30

Day 3: +25 coins. Total balance: 55

If the Villa leaves your wallet, your Daily Reward Streak resets. The new owner of the Villa will start from Daily Reward Streak: Day 1.

Things to note:

1. Most marketplaces are custodial. When you list, the NFT moves out of your wallet into theirs.
2. Daily Rewards are applied on a *per Villa* basis. So 2x Villas will mean a 2x Daily Reward, but the Daily Reward Streak will be based on how long you’ve owned that particular Villa.

**2. Social: Engaging in Discord**

The first step to building relationships is having real conversations. Each minute of messaging in Discord earns Coins.

Things to note:

1. Rewards are given on a per minute basis, not a per *message* basis. This deters spamming and encourages quality conversation.
2. Mee6 XP and Coins are not 1:1, they’ll be applied in some ratio as we balance the game.
3. Rewards are active only in holders’ channels, which means that you can only earn Discord XP if you are a Villager.

**3. Active: Quests and Roles**

Communities need a codified way to quantitatively reward active community members for their contributions. Quests allow us, or eventually the community, to assign quantitative values on certain tasks, projects, and creations.

The Founders announce new Quests as Seasons progress. Villagers can also request that Quests be added: for example, one Villager created a website for the Lake Henry neighborhood. Other created a map of Nakamota.

Neighborhood leaders can also create Quests for actions or winning competitions. Villagers can also be rewarded for taking on active roles like moderators, social chairs, and partnership leads.

**UPGRADES**

Each Upgrade has two functions:

1. Each Upgrade increases the rarity/rank of your Villa.
2. Each Upgrade unlocks some form of personalization or functionality for your Villa Page, with a few exceptions.

**Rarity Calculation**

Each Upgrade has a specified Coin value attached to it (the same Coin value with which you can buy the Upgrade). The total rarity of your Villa is calculated by the sum of all the Coin values of the Upgrades applied to it. For example, if you have an Upgrade worth 20 coins, and one worth 30 coins, your Villa’s coin value is 50 coins.

All rarities are displayed on the Official Leaderboard. Note that we are using the term rarity due to it being a well known paradigm in NFTs, but since rarity here is not determined by the likelihood of a certain trait appearing, a better term would be “Rank,” whereas one might have a “Rank 5 Villa” or a “Rank 1608 Villa.”

**Unlocks**

Each style and feature on the Villa Page is unlocked with a specific Upgrade, including themes, decals, links, embeds, new ways to interact with your Villa Art Gallery, and more.

**How to Get Upgrades**

Upgrades can be purchased either directly (you buy a specific upgrade for a specific coin amount), or in Mystery Boxes, which output a random Upgrade. Each Upgrade has a common, uncommon, rare, or mythic likelihood of appearing. Gold, Silver, and Bronze Mystery Boxes have differently weighted probabilities of commons through mythics appearing.

**Backpack**

When you purchase an Upgrade, it is stored in your Backpack, until you decide to apply to a Villa of your choosing. You can decide which Villa to apply each Upgrade, and also can withhold the Upgrade in your Backpack if you choose.

**Transferring Rarity**

Rarity increases are permanent and tied to the Villa; the Villa retains its rarity and rank even if transferred.

**XP VS. COINS**

For every Coin, you also earn one XP. Coins are spendable, whereas XP is not. Your Coin balance will increase as you earn and decrease as you purchase Upgrades, but your XP increases continually. Thus, Coins are for spending, XP is a metric for total value as a Villager.

**All-Time XP**

Coin balances go up and down, Upgrades are applied to specific Villas, and a Villager can own multiple Villas. When someone wants to know, “Who is the greatest Villager of all time,” they should look at All-Time XP. This XP value only goes up as more XP is accrued by the Villager.

One distinction to be made is that Rarity determines a Villa’s Rank, whereas XP determines a Villager’s rank.

**Seasonal XP**

The Village operates on Seasons cycles. Seasons last for a few weeks at first and grow progressively longer as time progresses.

In addition to their All-Time XP, each Villager also has Seasonal XP which restarts at the start of every Season. Seasonal XP is used to measure the performance of that Villager in the current Season.

**Tiers**

Seasonal XP places Villagers into Bronze, Silver, and Gold Tiers. The current Tier of the Villager is reflected in Discord name color and a Badge on Discord and the Villa Page. At the end of each Season, extra rewards, mystery boxes, or Upgrades are given out according to final Tiers.

**Trophies**

The highest earning players earn a Trophy for their final place in the Season. These Trophies are displayed permanently in Discord and on your Villa Page, unlike Badges from Gold, Silver, and Bronze Tiers which are dynamic.

# **Season 0**

Currently we are in what we refer to as “Season 0.” This is the period of time between mint and the activation of Villa Pages, Coins, and Upgrades with Season 1. You can still earn rewards that are applied to your starting balance of Coins in Season 1.

In today’s ecosystem, it’s imperative that everyone be using burner wallets to mint (a wallet created specifically for the mint with just enough Solana to cover the mint). Since Daily Reward streaks and Coin balances wipe when transferring wallets, we wanted to give enough time for Villagers to transfer from burner wallets to their main wallets before activating these mechanisms.

Thus, rewards are temporarily stored in the form of Discord/Mee6 XP and will be translated to your starting Coin balance at the start of Season 1.

# **The Future and Early Effectiveness**

The system is made to be adaptable and sustainable as the community and the ecosystem change forms and needs. Currently we are in Season 0, but we have already seen the effectivity of Neighborhood chats without the Villa Page, Community Rank Protocol, Coins, Upgrades, or Rarity boosts at play. Every Neighborhood has nominated or elected moderators and a lead moderator. Most Neighborhoods have created community roadmaps, community led social media, attended and created social events. Some have also brought on engineers, social chairs, and partnership chairs.

These are very strong beginnings to a powerhouse community and the path to a decentralized and empowered organization. The team have been careful to dub ourselves as “The Founders,” but not “The Leaders” or even “Admins.” We encourage the movement towards decentralization, and these early signs of community empowerment on our first week are great indicators of a bright future for the Village.
